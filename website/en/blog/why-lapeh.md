# Why We Built Lapeh?

_Written on December 25, 2025 by robyajo_

In the Node.js world, freedom is a double-edged sword. You can organize files however you like, choose any library, and write code in any style.

However, this freedom often becomes a major problem when working in teams.

> "Where should the Controller go? In `controllers` or `handlers` folder?"
> "Do we use `mongoose` or `sequelize` or `prisma`?"
> "How do we handle errors? Use `try-catch` in every function?"

These questions waste time. Developers spend energy on _setup_ and _structure debates_ rather than _building features_.

## The Birth of Lapeh

Lapeh exists to answer that chaos. Our philosophy is simple: **Convention over Configuration**.

We made the hard decisions upfront so you don't have to think about them again:

1.  **Standardized Folder Structure**: Every Lapeh project has the same structure. New developers can understand it in minutes.
2.  **Prisma ORM**: We chose Prisma for its Type-safety and best Developer Experience today.
3.  **Express.js**: A battle-tested framework, stable, and with the largest ecosystem.

## Our Vision

We want Lapeh to be the _de facto_ standard for Node.js backend development in Indonesia (and the world!). We want developers to be able to say:

> "Oh, this uses Lapeh? Okay, I know where to find the files."

With Lapeh, we hope team productivity increases, bugs decrease, and software development becomes more enjoyable.

Let's join this journey! 🚀
