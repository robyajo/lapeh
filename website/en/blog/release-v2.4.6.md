# Lapeh v2.4.6 Release: More Stable and Complete Documentation

_Written on December 28, 2025 by robyajo_

Today is a big day for the Lapeh Framework community! We just released version **v2.4.6** focusing on stability, ease of deployment, and better developer experience.

## What's New?

### 1. CLI and `module-alias` Improvements

Many users reported `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` issues when running projects in production environments. We have fixed this by integrating `module-alias` more robustly and ensuring all `@lapeh/*` paths resolve correctly in both JavaScript and TypeScript runtimes.

### 2. PM2 Cluster Mode Support

Now, the `ecosystem.config.js` generated by Lapeh supports Cluster mode (`instances: "max"`).

- Your app will automatically use all available CPU cores on the VPS.
- Performance increases 2x-4x without changing app code.
- Zero-downtime reload on updates.

### 3. Official Documentation Website

You are reading it right now! We launched [lapeh-doc.vercel.app](https://lapeh-doc.vercel.app) as a knowledge hub.

- **Fast Search**: Find functions or configurations in seconds.
- **Complete Guides**: From installation to VPS deployment.
- **Dark Mode**: Comfortable for eyes when coding at night.

## Next Steps

If you already have a Lapeh project, simply update your dependencies:

```bash
npm install lapeh@latest
```

Thank you for using Lapeh Framework! Your support means a lot to us in continuing to advance the JavaScript ecosystem.
