# New Era of Lapeh: New Identity & Global Standardization

_December 28, 2025_ • 👤 robyajo • 🏷️ _Announcement_

Today marks an important step in the evolution of the Lapeh Framework. We are updating our identity and standardizing documentation to support a broader global community.

## 👋 New Identity: robyajo

To align our identity across all platforms (GitHub, NPM, and Social Media), we are officially using the handle **robyajo** as the primary developer identity.

This change has been applied across all project metadata, `package.json` files, and documentation footers. It's a small but significant step for future branding consistency.

## 🌏 Go Global: English Documentation

One of the biggest community requests has been the availability of documentation in English. We heard you!

Starting with this version, Lapeh Framework documentation is fully available in **English**. You can switch languages via the dropdown menu in the top right corner of this website.

We hope this opens the door for developers from around the world to try, use, and contribute to the Lapeh Framework.

## 🛡️ "Expressive Validator"

We have also adjusted the terminology for our validation feature. The term "Laravel-style Validator" is now referred to as **"Expressive Validator"** or **"Simple Syntax"**.

Why? Because although the syntax is inspired by Laravel (like `required|email|min:8`), the underlying implementation uses the power of **Zod**, modified for a better TypeScript experience. We want to emphasize that this validation stands on its own as a robust solution, not just an imitation.

## 📦 What's Next?

We are preparing exciting new features in the 2026 Roadmap. Stay tuned to this blog for future updates!

Thank you for being part of the Lapeh journey.
